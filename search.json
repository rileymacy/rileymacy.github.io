    "title": "The Result of Pitchers Using Foreign Substances and Their Effect on Hitting Statistics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2021, Major League baseball was faced with an issue of pitchers using foreign substances to help gain grip and in turn improve their spin rates. In June of 2021, the MLB decided to start cracking down on this by checking pitchers for these foreign substances. The punishment would be a ten game suspension by the league if caught. This resulted in a heavy decrease in spin rate of pitchers and a decrease in other stats. I decided to look at the effect that it had on hitters’ stats. I initially believed that hitters’ stats would greatly improve. The first stat looked at was whether or not there was a difference in the type of hit. The hit types were fly ball, ground ball, line drives, and other. In theory the increased spin rates would cause more fly balls and ground balls, with line drives coming at a premium. However, between the 2019 season to the 2023 season there was little difference between the amount of line drives hit besides an increase in the 2020 season most likely due to no fans in the stadium during COVID games.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nhit23 <- read_csv(\"hitting2023.csv\")\nhit22 <- read_csv(\"hitting2022.csv\")\nhit21 <- read_csv(\"hitting2021.csv\")\nhit20 <- read_csv(\"hitting2020.csv\")\nhit19 <- read_csv(\"hitting2019.csv\")\nhits22 <- read_csv(\"hit2022.csv\")\nhits21 <- read_csv(\"hit2021.csv\")\nhits20 <- read_csv(\"hit2020.csv\")\nhits19 <- read_csv(\"hit2019.csv\")\n\nh23 <- hit23 %>% mutate(Season = 2023)\nh22 <- hit22 %>% mutate(Season = 2022)\nh21 <- hit21 %>% mutate(Season = 2021)\nh20 <- hit20 %>% mutate(Season = 2020)\nh19 <- hit19 %>% mutate(Season = 2019)\nht22 <- hits22 %>% mutate(Season = 2022)\nht21 <- hits21 %>% mutate(Season = 2021)\nht19 <- hits19 %>% mutate(Season = 2019)\n\nhitstats <- bind_rows(h23,h22,h21,h20,h19)\nteamhits2 <- bind_rows(ht22,ht21,ht19)\n\nhitstat <- hitstats %>% \n  mutate(`SO%`= gsub(\"\\\\%\", \"\", `SO%`)) %>% \n  mutate(`SO%` = as.numeric(`SO%`)) %>% \n  mutate(`HardH%`= gsub(\"\\\\%\", \"\", `HardH%`)) %>% \n  mutate(`HardH%` = as.numeric(`HardH%`)) %>% \n    mutate(`LD%`= gsub(\"\\\\%\", \"\", `LD%`)) %>% \n  mutate(`LD%` = as.numeric(`LD%`)) %>% \n  mutate(`GB%`= gsub(\"\\\\%\", \"\", `GB%`)) %>% \n  mutate(`GB%` = as.numeric(`GB%`)) %>%\n  mutate(`FB%`= gsub(\"\\\\%\", \"\", `FB%`)) %>% \n  mutate(`FB%` = as.numeric(`FB%`)) %>% \n  mutate(`HR%`= gsub(\"\\\\%\", \"\", `HR%`)) %>% \n  mutate(`HR%` = as.numeric(`HR%`))\n  \nhitstack <- hitstat %>%\n  group_by(Season) %>% \n  summarise(\n    avgLD = mean(`LD%`),\n    avgFB = mean(`FB%`),\n    avgGB = mean(`GB%`)\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    `totalh%` = 100,\n    avgOther = `totalh%` - avgLD - avgFB - avgGB)\n\nhitwide <- hitstack %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"avg\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Hit\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=hitwide, aes(x=Season, weight=Hit, fill=Type))+ \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"red\", \"yellow\", \"dark green\", \"light blue\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x= \"Season\",\n    y= \"Type of Hit\",\n    title= \"League Averages of Type of Hit\",\n    subtitle= \"The amount of each type of hit does not increase or decrease much over \\nthe last five seasons even with the spider tack.\",\n    caption= \"Source: BaseballReference | By Riley Macy\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size= 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size= 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next stat is number of home runs hit by each team compared to the league average. You can see the steady decrease from the 2019 season to the 2021 season most likely due to the foreign substances starting to be used. However, you would expect a large increase from the 2022 season after the crackdown began but the amount of home runs continued to decrease.\n\n\nCode\nhtstat2 <- teamhits2 %>% \n  group_by(Season, Tm, )\n\nhravg <- htstat2 %>% \n  group_by(Season) %>% \n  summarise(\n    avghr = mean(HR)\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=htstat2, aes(x=Season, y=HR, group=Tm), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=hravg, aes(x=Season, y=avghr), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2021.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x= 2021.18, y = 125, label = \"Foreign Substance \\n Crackdown\"), color = \"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Season\",\n    y= \"Number of Home Runs\",\n    title= \"League Average of Homeruns\",\n    subtitle= \"The amount of Home Runs hit since 2019 has been steadily declining. \\n The foreign substance scandal does not show much influence.\",\n    caption= \"Source: BaseballReference | By Riley Macy\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size= 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size= 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final stat looked at was the percentage of hard hits. The hard hit percentage is a stat in baseball that looks at balls hit harder than 95 mph. With pitchers spin rate up making weaker contact was probable but between when the crackdown on foreign substances changed their was little change in the amount of hard hits in the league average.\n\n\nCode\navghrpct <- hitstat %>% \n  group_by(Season) %>% \n  summarise(\n  avghrpt = mean(`HardH%`))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=hitstat, aes(x=Season, y=`HardH%`, group=Tm), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=hitstat, aes(x=Season, y=`HardH%`, group=Tm), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=avghrpct, aes(x=Season, y=avghrpt, group=1), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=avghrpct, aes(x=Season, y=avghrpt, group=Season), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2021.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x= 2021, y = 50, label = \"Foreign Substance \\n Crackdown\"), color = \"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Season\",\n    y= \"Hard Hit Pecrentage\",\n    title= \"Team Hard hit Percent vs League Average\",\n    subtitle= \"The League Average of hard hit percentage does not change much between the seasons.\",\n    caption= \"Source: BaseballReference | By Riley Macy\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size= 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size= 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pitchers may have seemed to be throwing crazier pitches but the statistics show that hitters tendencies and averages did not change even with the crackdown starting on pitchers and foreign substances."
